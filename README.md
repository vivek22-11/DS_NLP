NLP- Natural Language Processing

Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult
to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of the text
or voice data.

Natural language processing is a machine learning technology that gives computers
the ability to interpret,manipulate and comprehead human language.


Industrial Used -

1)Translation:
Translation is one of the top—and original—use cases of NLP. 
The primary NLP-based interpretation machine was introduced during the 1950s by Georgetown and IBM, which could consequently translate 60 Russian sentences to English. 
Today, translation applications influence NLP and AI to comprehend and precisely translate worldwide dialects in both text and voice designs.

‍2)Autocorrect:
Stakeholders utilize NLP to recognize incorrectly spelled words. 
They do this by cross-matching words to an appropriate word set via a language dictionary using the word reference used as a preparation set. 
The incorrectly spelled word is then put through the machine learning algorithm that addresses words in the preparation set, adds, eliminates, or replaces letters from the word. 
It also matches the words to a batch that fits the general importance of a sentence.

‍3)Autocomplete Sentences:
Autocomplete uses NLP with specific machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning, recurrent neural networks (RNN), or latent semantic analysis (LSA) to predict where the sentence is going. 

‍4)Conversational AI:
Conversational AI can communicate through human language. 
Conversational AI is usually deployed as a voice assistant like Siri, Cortana, and Google Home. 
Another example of a conversational AI is a voice layer on a website or a virtual call center agent.

‍5)Voice Recognition:
Voice recognition, also called automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech to text (STT), is a kind of algorithm that converts human speech from 
its analog form  to a digital format so that the AI can understand and recognize it (also learn how NLP fuels chatbots). 


Automatic Text Summarization:
Automatic text summarization involves shortening long messages or sections and creating a unique, summarizing paragraph. 

There are two fundamental techniques:

1. Extractive outline:
   The output message will be a mix of significant sentences removed straightforwardly from the first message.
   
3. Abstractive summary:
   The point is to comprehend the overall significance of sentences, decipher the specific situation, and create new sentences based on the general importance. 


‍For both techniques, NLP is utilized in the text translation steps, which are: 

1.Cleaning the text from filling words.

2.Testing the message with more limited sentences (tokens).

3.Making a comparability network that addresses relationships between tokens.

4.Working out sentence positions based on semantic likeness.
  
5.Choosing sentences with the highest levels to create the outline (either extractive or abstractive).
